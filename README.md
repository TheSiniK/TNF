# Finder

A simple code that searches a personal db. It comes in two different versions, cpp version and Python version. The cpp version is more advanced and faster, but harder to use.

## How to use Python version

To use the Python version, simply run the 'Finder.py' code. The program will guide you through the rest.

## How to use cpp version

To use the Cpp version, run 'make' in the cppVersion folder and then simply run './Finder' to run the program. 

Ps: To get the db you can email me at 'sininoir@gmail.com'. Also please state why you want it.
